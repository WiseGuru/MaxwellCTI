# Learning how to troubleshoot
Why did I put "learning how to troubleshoot" before the IT-specific ones? Because this is about *how* you approach problems. A person with very little knowledge on a subject can reach the correct answer if they follow basic guidelines when working on problems. 
1. [3 Simple Rules to troubleshooting ANYTHING. - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic5R4C5HRUg)
2. [Troubleshooting Technology Basics - Laptops - Ep. 1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ng4bswjxTxw)

There are two distinct ways to resolve an issue; *heuristic* and *logical*.
1. *Heuristic* troubleshooting relies on the technician's experience and knowledge of the system, and while it can lead to quick fixes, it can fail on more complex issues or only provide temporary solutions that occur again later.
	1. For example, rebooting the computer as a first step for any issue.
2. *Logical* troubleshooting follows a series of steps to clearly identify what the problem is, what caused, and how to permanently resolve it.
	1. This often takes longer, but is more thorough, enhances your understanding of the system, and can give longer-lasting results.

Each of these methods have their strengths and weaknesses, but are best used in tandem. When you're starting out, however, focus on *logical troubleshooting* to build your experience to help with *heuristic troubleshooting*.

However, the key to effective troubleshooting is *defining the problem*. When someone comes to you with a problem, they will typically give you *symptoms of the problem*; my internet isn't working, my computer won't turn on, I can't log in to my computer. The problem is what causes these symptoms, and can be more difficult to determine. The symptom "my internet isn't working" could be cause by the internet service provider experiencing an outage to the laptop being in Airplane mode.

For help with logical troubleshooting, [CompTIA](https://www.comptia.org/blog/troubleshooting-methodology) has a handy little blog that describes their steps, but I think [Limble](https://limblecmms.com/blog/what-is-troubleshooting/) has a better guide and flowchart:

# Building a Homelab
I go into it more in [[Career Growth/Intro to IT and Cybersecurity/Building a Homelab\|Building a Homelab]], but if you're just getting started in IT, I highly recommend setting up a homelab to get hands-on experience with the hardware and software you'll be supporting.

Building a homelab demonstrates initiative and gets you real-world experience without having a job in IT.

# IT Helpdesk/Support Classes and Lectures
Below are a few courses, classes, and channels that cover the basics you'll want to cover. I never got the CompTIA A+, and I have heard various people say that they learned a lot of useful information from it, and that it was a complete waste of time.

> When I mention Udemy courses, should always try to get them on sale.
> - If you do not see them on sale or don't want to wait, you can either copy and paste the URL into an incognito browser window; there should be a banner at the top of the page to "redeem" a discount code. When I tested it, I was able to log in while the code changed and the price was a little higher, it was still less than $20.
> - You can also use [Gale](https://link.gale.com/apps/UDEMY) and enter your school or a participating local public library to get discount codes.

1. [IT Support Technical Skills Bootcamp | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/it-support-technical-skills-training-part-1/)
	1. As usual, don't buy a Udemy course at full price; wait for it to go on sale in a week or two.
	2. 39 hours of lectures on a range of critical topics.
	3. From what previews I've seen, it looks like a thorough overview of common applications and technology used in corporate environments.
	4. Taken a little bit at a time and using a homelab should give you a great foundation and feeling of confidence for your first IT Helpdesk/Support job.
2. [MS-102 Microsoft 365 Administrator Expert course with SIMS | Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/ms100course)
	1. Many things are moving to the cloud, and Microsoft 365 is an integral part of corporate infrastructure; you will stand out if you have hands-on experience managing it.
	2. This is a great looking course with sims, and is only 13 hours long.
3. [Kevtech IT Support](https://www.youtube.com/@KevtechITSupport/playlists)
	1. This guy has a ton of videos and playlists going over every aspect of an IT Helpdesk environment.
	2. He's also on Udemy, but watch is free videos first to make sure his format works for you.
4. Techtubers
	1. Watching techtubers talk shop is a great way to get learn by immersion; see trends in the techspace, get different perspectives, and fall down niche dives into unknown areas of tech that might spark your interest... (*note that these channels are not listed in any particular order*)

Maybe not directly helpful to IT support, but they're entertaining, keep you interested in creative, and keep you in the know.
			1. [LTT - How to Build a PC, the last guide youâ€™ll ever need! (2024 Update)](https://youtu.be/s1fxZ-VWs2U?)

		11. [Lawrence Systems](https://www.youtube.com/@LAWRENCESYSTEMS) is a great resource for [[Career Growth/Intro to IT and Cybersecurity/Building a Homelab\|homelab]] setup and infrastructure configuration. It can be a little dry, but great information.
