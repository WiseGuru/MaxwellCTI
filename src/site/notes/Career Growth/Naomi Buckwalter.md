*Written in early 2024*

I was able to catch most of a livestream with [Naomi Buckwalter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-buckwalter/), [Elizabeth McConnaughey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emcconn/), and [Chad White](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadcwhite/), discussing the state of Tech and Cybersecurity Hiring in 2024. I came in a few minutes late, but it was highly informative.

I haven't gone back to rewatch from the beginning, but here are my notes from when I joined 10-15 minutes late.

Liz mentioned that she reviews resumes, and I reached out after the stream.

### Keys to Writing a Resume

2. Need to be able to speak to everything on the resume
3. When you enter experience, speak to the impact
	1. I think I've already done this...
4. Know who your audience is
	1. The different institutions will have completely different personalities

7. Adding color to resumes can be a bad thing

	2. Think about this as a dating profile
		1. "Women don't want to see all your hunting pics"
	3. What networking groups are you involved in?

	4. What projects?
	5. Do you speak a second language?
		1. And speak to the level

### How to find a mentor
1. Look on LinkedIn/MeetUp to find local groups, and just network/talk with people
2. Really critical to have a clear idea of where you want to be in the next 5-10 years
	1. If I know exactly where I want to work, I would look for people in those places

		2. Then you can either reach out to them, or you can then look for other people who are on a similar path
3. Networking messages
	1. Bad questions
		1. Do you have 30 minutes?
		2. Can you look at my resume?
		3. How do I get a job?
	2. Good questions

		3. I saw you were at X for Y years; how did this transition look like? Any tips?

### Parting Comments
#### Chad:
1. Slow your roll, be intentional, be specific, be kind (especially to yourself), and just keep working on it
#### Liz:
1. Don't take it^[Meaning anything related to job hunting; rejections, poorly created job postings, etc.] personally
	1. If you take everything personally, it will weigh you down, and put into a victim pit, and it can be very hard to get out of
2. Connect with local recruiters
3. Look at the larger established companies to find those entry positions
