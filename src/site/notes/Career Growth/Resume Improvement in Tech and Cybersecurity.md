*Written in early 2024*

I've worked hard over the last few months to dial in my resume, and I've received tons of advice, seen lots of samples, and had many attempts at making the best resume I can. 

1. Write for impact
	1. What did you do? How did it impact the organization?
	2. Hard numbers are easier for a hiring manager to understand.
		1. Estimate numbers if you have to, but be prepared to defend them (e.g., napkin math)
2. Respect other people's time
	1. Be succinct
		1. 
	2. Highlight what's important
	3. Avoid fluff and crap
3. Write for the ATS
	1. If you convert your resume into a text document, is it still readable?
		1. Tables, columns, graphics, all cause interpretation issues.
4. Maximize your space
	1. Arial is digitally readable down to 9- and 10-point font
	2. Don't include your picture or other nice-looking graphics which can take up space
5. Use ChatGPT
	1. Ask it "trim the word count" of your job posts
