[Joshua Bregler on LinkedIn: 7 best practices for enterprise attack surface management](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/breglercissp_7-best-practices-for-enterprise-attack-surface-activity-7161741020362170369-Sopd?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

On Fridays, we build things... This week...  
  
Attack Surface Management!  
  
Understanding the external perspective of your organization is incredibly important. Comprehension of your organization's exposed digital real estate is important to understand your attackers' point-of-view.  
  
But the fact is... the products on the market that can do this for you may be out of your budget.  
  
But have hope! You can build this on your own. And it's a lot of fun!  
  
The [CSO Online](https://www.linkedin.com/company/csoonline/) article is great for framing the basic tenants: [https://lnkd.in/ec29vBF4](https://lnkd.in/ec29vBF4)  
  
Ultimately... you can strap together a few basic kinds of tools and get a decent idea of what your attackers see and start making changes to mitigate the issues.  
  
Here's some open source tools to get you started. This is by no means exhaustive and there is A LOT more you can do/add for your situation or industry. But start here and grow where it makes sense...  
  
- Domain and Sub-domain Discovery  
-- OWASP Amass is legit and does this well among other things: [https://lnkd.in/eSTt6Nhj](https://lnkd.in/eSTt6Nhj)  
-- SubBrute is fast and unapologetic and has some nice upgrades: [https://lnkd.in/ev2vZ5Jz](https://lnkd.in/ev2vZ5Jz)  
-- Knock is simple and efficient: [https://lnkd.in/eFKibXbf](https://lnkd.in/eFKibXbf)  
  
- Port Scanning (know your potential network ingress points)  
-- nmap is the OG: [https://nmap.org/](https://nmap.org/)  
-- zenmap is nmap's prettier sibling; just has a nice GUI and helpers: [https://nmap.org/zenmap/](https://nmap.org/zenmap/)  
  
- Vulnerability/Configuration Scanning  
-- nuclei is nifty and customizable: [https://lnkd.in/eFFTevQZ](https://lnkd.in/eFFTevQZ)  
-- ZAP is wonderful for web app scans: [https://www.zaproxy.org/](https://www.zaproxy.org/)  
-- Burp is amazing for a million reasons: [https://lnkd.in/eFbD_-Gd](https://lnkd.in/eFbD_-Gd)  
  
Is this basic? Yes. But you gotta get basic right before you do more.  
  
Build confidence in your exposed attack surface area. And have fun doing it!  
  
It's a beautiful day to build beautiful things.
