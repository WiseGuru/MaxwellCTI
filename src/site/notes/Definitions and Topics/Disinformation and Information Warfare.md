#### Disinformation, Misinformation, DIP, and Propaganda
*Disinformation* is the "false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumors) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth."^[[Disinformation Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/disinformation)]

While I like to think of *misinformation* as benign spreading of false information, through misunderstanding or similar, it's often used interchangeably with *disinformation*. 

*DIP*, or *Deceptive Imagery Persuasion*, is the use of images (real or generated) as a kernel of truth to legitimize a lie. For example, using video footage of a violent protest from 5 years ago when describing a relatively peaceful protest that occurred yesterday.

*Propaganda* is the "the spreading of ideas, information, or rumor for the purpose of helping or injuring an institution, a cause, or a person,"^[[Propaganda Definition & Meaning - Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/propaganda)] and often uses *disinformation* and *DIP* to accomplish its goals, and often uses key phrases or ear worms (or "technical tasks"^["In addition to general guidelines, bloggers are also provided with "technical tasks" â€“ keywords and talking points on specific issues, such as Ukraine, Russia's internal opposition and relations with the West." -[Russian web brigades - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_web_brigades#Methods)]) to plant an idea and track spread.

*Information Warfare* or *Information Domain Warfare* is "the battlespace use and management of information and communication technology (ICT) in pursuit of a competitive advantage over an opponent... \[and\] the manipulation of information trusted by a target without the target's awareness so that the target will make decisions against their interest but in the interest of the one conducting information warfare."^[[Information warfare - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_warfare)]

Ryan McBeth is a great resource for information on disinformation, and I've decided to link to several of his videos here where he discusses the real-world effects of disinformation and information domain warfare.
