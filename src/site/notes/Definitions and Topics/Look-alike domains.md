#### Look-alike domains
- *Look-alike domains* are domains which have been registered that are intended to look similar to an official domain.
	- For example, instead of `acmeco`, it's `acneco` or `acmec0`
- There are also characters in the [Cyrillic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrillic_script) that look almost identical to the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet), but are otherwise coded differently
	- For example, replace the *h* in `homepage` with *Һ*, resulting in `Һomepage`
- This can be particularly effective in [[phishing\|phishing]] and malicious links
	- *Free* services like [dnstwister](https://dnstwister.report/) allow you to search with your domain and identify similar domains
	- *Paid* services like [Flare](https://docs.flare.io/look-alike-domains), [KnowBe4](https://www.knowbe4.com/domain-doppelganger), and others^[NOTE: I don't have any affiliation with these tools, and am using them purely as an example, not an endorsement.] can automate *look-alike domain* search or reporting.
