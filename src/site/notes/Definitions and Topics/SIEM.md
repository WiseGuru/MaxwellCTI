#### SIEM
- A *Security Information and Event Manager* (*SIEM*) is a one-stop-shop for security log and event analysis in an environment
	- Often described as a "single pane of glass" for reviewing security information
	- They can have client agents, but often just inspect the network from a central server
	- As with many things, the line kind of blurs a little as features for products grow
- You will hear the acronym pronounced either as "sim" or "seem"
	- Microsoft^[[What Is SIEM? | Microsoft Security](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-siem)], TechTarget,^[[What is SIEM? | A Definition from TechTarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/security-information-and-event-management-SIEM)], and Splunk^[[SIEM: Security Information & Event Management Explained | Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/siem-security-information-event-management.html)] all say it should be pronounced as "sim" with a silent E.
	- According to exabeam^[[Looking Back at the Evolution of SIEM - Exabeam](https://www.exabeam.com/siem/looking-back-at-the-evolution-of-siem/)], it's pronounced as "seem" in Europe, but "sim" in the US
	- I don't think it matters unless someone really cares about it; if they really care about it, they need more important things to work on.
