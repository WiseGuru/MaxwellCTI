#### CIA Triad
The *CIA Triad* is a widely used model in cybersecurity that outlines three main objectives for securing information systems:
1. **Confidentiality**
	1. Ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
	2. This involves protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access and disclosure, typically through the use of encryption, access controls, and security protocols.
2. **Integrity**
	1. Safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and processing methods.
		1. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner.
	2. Integrity is maintained through various mechanisms such as hashing, checksums, and digital signatures.
3. **Availability**
	1. Ensuring that authorized users have reliable access to information and associated resources when needed.
	2. This includes protecting systems against attacks that could render them unusable, such as denial-of-service attacks, and implementing backup and disaster recovery procedures to restore information and systems in case of a failure or catastrophe.
