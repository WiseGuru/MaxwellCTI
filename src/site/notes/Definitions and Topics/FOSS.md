#### FOSS
- *Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)* is free and open source. 
	- This phenomena is surprising to some, taken for granted by others, and the development frequently goes thankless.
- Pros
	- Free
		- The software is made freely available for anyone to access
		- This makes it extremely *accessible* for smaller organizations, students, and really anyone
	- Open Source
		- The underlying code is made available for anyone to access and review
		- This can lead to safer code than traditional, closed-source methods
			- Developers (and people generally) are more likely to review their code and do things properly if they know the whole world can see it
			- Anyone with the requisite skill^[Or access to a sufficiently sophisticated chatbot] can review the code and understand how it works, and report vulnerabilities or areas of improvement
		- If the original developer abandons the project, another person with the requisite skill can pick up where they left off
- Cons
	- Free
		- Projects often rely on donations and a dedicated core of developers, who can give up the project at any point in time
	- Open Source
		- Other unscrupulous developers can fork the project, rebrand and republish it, inserting malicious code or just making profit off of other people's work
