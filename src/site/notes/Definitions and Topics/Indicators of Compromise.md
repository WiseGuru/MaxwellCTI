#### Indicators of Compromise or Attack
- *Indicators of Compromise* are data on a system which indicates it may have been compromised or hacked.
	- For example, in [[Tool Deep-Dives/Windows/Active Directory\|Active Directory]] an *IOC* might be an AD account with domain-admin privileges and no username (or an unusual/disguised username)
- *Indicators of Attack* are data on a system which indicates it may have been attacked
	- For example, dozens of failed login attempts to a single user account.
- In [[Security Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/MITRE ATT&CK\|MITRE ATT&CK]], *Detections* might include *IOCs* or *Indicators of Attack*
