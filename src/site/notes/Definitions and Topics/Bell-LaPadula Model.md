#### Bell-LaPadula Model
- The *Bell-LaPadula Model* is used to achieve Confidentiality
- Developed for the DoD, assumes a strict hierarchy with clearly-defined roles and responsibilities
- "no write down, no read up"
	- *No write down*: When someone *creates* content, it can only be access by people at their *authorization level or above*
		- e.g., Documents created at *Secret* level could be read by people with *Top Secret* clearance, but not *Confidential* clearance
	- *No read up*: You are only allowed to *read* content at your *authorization level or lower*
		- e.g., someone with *Secret* clearance could read *Confidential* documents, but not *Top Secret* documents
