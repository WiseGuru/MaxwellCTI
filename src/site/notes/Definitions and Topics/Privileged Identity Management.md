#### Privileged Identity Management
- *Privileged Identity Management* (*PIM*) is a subset of identity management focused specifically on managing and securing the accounts and identities that have elevated or administrative access to critical IT systems.
- The main goals of *PIM* are to control, monitor, and protect the access of privileged accounts to prevent breaches or misuse, and includes the following functions:
	- *Access Controls*
		- Ensuring that only people who need access have it
	- *Credential Management*
		- Ensures strong authentication controls, such as complex/rotating passwords and [[MFA\|MFA]]
	- *Session Management and Monitoring*
		- Track and record activities of privileged accounts, which helps to detect misuse or malicious activity
	- *Least Privilege Enforcement*
		- Only assign the minimum permissions to the account to limit an attackers ability to pivot
			- e.g., restricting account permissions for IT Administrator's user accounts, and creating new accounts to enable administrators to perform specific tasks or maintain specific servers
	- *Audit and Compliance*
