#### Privileged Access Management
- *Privileged Access Management* (*PAM*) refers to a set of cybersecurity strategies and technologies for exerting control over the elevated ("privileged") access and permissions enjoyed by users, accounts, processes, and systems across an IT environment. 
	- PAM encompasses a broader range of controls and technologies specifically designed to protect privileged access to critical IT assets and infrastructure than [[Definitions and Topics/Privileged Identity Management\|Privileged Identity Management (PIM)]]
- *PAM* includes several key functions and features:
	- *Credential Management*
		- Securely manages the credentials for privileged accounts to prevent unauthorized access.
		- This includes automated password rotation, secure storage of credentials, and controlled access to passwords.
	- *Session Management*
		- Monitors, manages, and records sessions that involve elevated privileges.
		- This allows organizations to audit activities and track any changes made during these sessions, providing forensic capabilities to trace any issues back to specific actions.
	- *Access Control*
		- Implements strict authentication and authorization procedures to ensure that only authorized personnel can gain access to critical systems and data.
		- This might include [[MFA\|MFA]] and biometric verification methods.
	- *Least Privilege*
		- Enforces the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users, accounts, and processes are granted only the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their functions.
		- This increases difficulty in gaining access to privileged accounts and limits the potential damage of a breach involving a privileged account.
	- *Threat Detection and Response*
		- Integrates with security systems to detect unusual activities that might indicate a security threat.
		- PAM solutions can automatically respond to potential threats by revoking access or alerting security personnel.
	- *Audit and Compliance Reporting*
		- Generates detailed logs and reports for all privileged session activities, which are essential for compliance with regulatory standards and for conducting internal audits.
