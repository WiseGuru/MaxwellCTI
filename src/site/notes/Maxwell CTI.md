# Welcome to Maxwell CTI!

Hello and welcome! This blog is a documentation of my journey into cybersecurity; as I take classes, attend seminars, participate in cyber ranges and HTB/THM-style labs, and pursue my own interests, I will document the things I learn and work on here. 

As I work on projects, I will document and publish what I learn. There are many pages in progress (i.e., with bad grammar, syntax, incomplete information, etc.), but I try to keep things tight and professional.

### New here?
Below is a list of the pages I've updated recently; you can also search from the top right, or scroll through everything on the left.

Still not sure where to start? Why not check out my guide on [[Technical Guides/Securing Email\|securing email with SPF, DKIM, and DMARC]]?


### Find me everywhere at [wyz.guru](https://wyz.guru)



## Recently Modified Pages
Take this with a grain of salt; I synchronize my Obsidian vault between devices with Resilio Sync, which can set an artificial "last modified" timestamp.
