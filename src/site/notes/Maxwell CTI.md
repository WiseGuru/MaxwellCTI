# Welcome to Maxwell CTI!

Hello and welcome! This blog is a documentation of my journey into cybersecurity; as I take classes, attend seminars, participate in cyber ranges and HTB/THM-style labs, and pursue my own interests, I will document the things I learn and work on here.

### New here?
Why not check out my notes on the [[BHIS Antisyphon and Webinars/BlackHills SOC Core/BHIS SOCC Notes Overview\|Black Hills Information Security SOC Analyst Core course?]]


### My Other Sites
Because I actually can't contain myself, here's my (non-exhaustive) list of other sites and projects I'm working on.

[WiseGuru's CCNA Definitions](https://ccnadefinitions.com/)
- A collection of many of my notes (original content only) from studying for and passing the [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html)

[Wisdom Dump](https://wisdump.work/)
- My personal blog with other projects that may be only tangentially related to security - *tread carefully*

[Maxwell Hackswell](https://www.maxwellhackswell.com/)
- Articles I write in *Wisdump* that reach a certain level of professionalism or are relatively static in nature trickle up to my *Maxwell Hackswell* WP site.
- Sorry it's so slow, forgive me senpai...

[WiseGuru Â· GitHub](https://github.com/WiseGuru)
- My GitHub with a few projects I'm working on and the source files for most of these [Digital Garden](https://www.maxwellhackswell.com/digital-garden/how-to-host-a-digital-garden-on-cloudflare/) sites are hosted.
