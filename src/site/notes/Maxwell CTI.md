# Welcome to Maxwell CTI!

Hello and welcome! This blog is a documentation of my journey into cybersecurity; as I take classes, attend seminars, participate in cyber ranges and HTB/THM-style labs, and pursue my own interests, I will document the things I learn and work on here.

I'm alternating between working on me [[home network upgrade\|home network upgrade (to be sanitized)]] and implementing a Security Onion SIEM for the whole network, and learning [[Tool Deep-Dives/Python/Python Introduction\|Python]], which will help me on my ebook footnotes project.



### New here?
Why not check out my notes on the [[BHIS Antisyphon and Webinars/BlackHills SOC Core/BHIS SOCC Notes Overview\|Black Hills Information Security SOC Analyst Core course?]]


### Find me everywhere else on [linktr.ee/wiseguru](https://linktr.ee/wiseguru)
Because I can't contain myself to one site.
