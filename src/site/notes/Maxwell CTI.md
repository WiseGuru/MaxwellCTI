# Welcome to Maxwell CTI!

Hello and welcome! This blog is a documentation of my journey into cybersecurity; as I take classes, attend seminars, participate in cyber ranges and HTB/THM-style labs, and pursue my own interests, I will document the things I learn and work on here.

As I work on projects, I try to document and publish what I learn. There will be many pages in progress (aka, with bad grammar, syntax, incomplete information, etc.), but I try to keep things tight and professional.

### New here?
Below is a list of the pages I've updated recently; you can also search from the top right, or scroll through everything on the left.

Still not sure where to start? Why not check out my notes on the [[BHIS Antisyphon and Webinars/BlackHills SOC Core/BHIS SOCC Notes Overview\|Black Hills Information Security SOC Analyst Core course?]] 


### Find me everywhere else on [linktr.ee/wiseguru](https://linktr.ee/wiseguru)
Because ~~two~~ ~~three~~ ~~four~~ *many* projects are better than one.


## Recently Modified Pages
Take this with a grain of salt; there will be false-edits from Resilio Sync^[Because whenever it synchronizes between devices, that's a "modification time".] and unpublished pages.
