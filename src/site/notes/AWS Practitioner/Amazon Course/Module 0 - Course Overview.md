So I started this course, but I ran into a few issues.
1. Very slow, very high-level.
	1. Definitely helpful if you've never used computers before, but I felt like I was not the target audience member
2. I don't understand how this course got past my ad blocker
	1. *Very pushy* on their products and solutions, like attending a time-share presentation to get a free cookie.

Anyway, I got annoyed with the course, found a few possible alternatives on YouTube that seemed more in-line with reality, and then got promptly sucked into other projects. At some point I'll revisit this, but right now I'm focusing on SIEMs, Malware Threat Analysis, and other more pertinent applications and tools.
