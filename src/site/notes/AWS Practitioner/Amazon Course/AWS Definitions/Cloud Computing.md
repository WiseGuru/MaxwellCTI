#### Cloud Computing
- The *on-demand delivery* of [[AWS Practitioner/Amazon Course/AWS Definitions/IT resources\|IT resources]] *over the Internet* with *pay-as-you-go* pricing
	1. [[AWS Practitioner/Amazon Course/AWS Definitions/IT resources\|IT resources]] are fundamental, broadly similar tools used by different companies
	2. *Over the internet* means it can be served to any device with *Internet* connectivity
	3. *Pay-as-you-go* means you pay for resources based on *need* and *use*, not simply having them, available
- Offers flexibility of being able to *request* and *release* resources as needed, only paying for *what's in use*
- Significantly reduces *CapEx* by increasing *OpEx*
	- Reduces the impact of under- or over-estimating required resources
- By *sharing* hardware resources, *individuals and companies with reduced need* can pay for less and have lower *idle resources* than self-hosted solutions
- *Resiliency* and *global reach* of cloud servers allows for rapid access across the world

### Deployment Models
1. Cloud-based
	1. All parts of the application are run in the cloud
	2. These applications could be designed and built for cloud use, or migrated from existing infrastructure
2. On-prem (private cloud)
	1. Applications are deployed using on-prem hardware
	2. Applications can be run in virtualized environments or on dedicated servers
3. Hybrid
	1. Cloud-based resources are connected to on-prem infrastructure
	2. This can be useful to meet compliance or regulations, while offloading non-regulated or other resources to the public cloud
