#### IT Resources
- *IT resources* are fundamental aspects of a corporation, and often *are not differentiators of performance* between companies.
	- e.g., that you run a *[[SQL\|SQL]] database* doesn't distinguish you from a competitor; the *data in the database* distinguishes you.
- This is often referred to by AWS as *The undifferentiated heavy lifting of IT*
