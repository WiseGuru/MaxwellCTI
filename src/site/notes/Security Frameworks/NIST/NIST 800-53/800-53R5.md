### What is it?
1. "**NIST Special Publication 800-53** is an [information security standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_security_standards "IT security standards") that provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for all U.S. federal [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems "Information systems") except those related to national security"^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53)]
	1. Rev. 5 published in Sept. 2020
	2. Rev. 4 was officially withdrawn on Sept. 23, 2021^[[nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf)]
2. Provides a critical framework
	1. 20 control families
		1. Access Control, Risk Management, etc.
	2. Each family has a set of security controls that can be implemented
		3. In Rev. 4, controls were ordered by Priority, but Rev 5 instead focuses on customized Risk Assessments to determine priority
3. Flexible framework that allows organizations to tailor controls to their organizations
	1. Achieved through risk assessments
4. *Required for organizations with federal access*
5. **What are 800-53A and 800-53B?**
	1. 800-53A and 800-53B are supporting documents for the SP 800-53 that help users and organizations interpret and action the main document.
	2. 800-53A "provides a *set of procedures for conducting assessments* of *security... and privacy controls* employed within federal information systems and organizations."^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#800-53A)]
		1. The procedures are designed to be tailored to an organizations unique needs and risk tolerances.
	3. 800-53B "provides a *set of baseline security... and privacy controls* for information systems and organizations."^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#800-53B)]
		1. Defines control impact levels relating to the three components of the [[CIA Triad\|CIA Triad]] using the "high water mark" standard, where the highest-rated component defines the impact level of the entire system.
			1. *Low-impact* systems have *low* impact across the triad
			2. *Moderate-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *moderate*, and *nothing* that is rated *high*
			3. *High-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *high*

### Biggest functional/organizational differences between Rev. 4 and Rev. 5
1. [[Security Frameworks/MITRE ATT&CK/MITRE ATT&CK\|MITRE]] created a spreadsheet tracking all updates from Rev.4 to Rev.5
	1. [Analysis of updates between 800-53 Rev. 5 and Rev. 4, by MITRE Corp. for ODNI (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r4-to-r5-comparison-workbook.xlsx)
2. Biggest thing is Privacy
	1. Privacy is now integrated across the entire document, and the DHS Privacy Compliance process^[[Understanding privacy compliance](https://www.dhs.gov/compliance)] can be used to better understand its impact.
	2. NIST provides a document that maps the Rev.4 Privacy Controls to their appropriate sections in Rev.5^[[Mapping: Appendix J Privacy Controls (Rev. 4) to Rev. 5 (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r4-appj-to-r5-comparison.xlsx)]
3. Removal of the "Priority" metric
	1. Change to a "Risk Assessment" model
		1. More effortful, more flexible
4. General language changes to be more inclusive and translate more easily between other frameworks
	1. More closely aligns with the NIST CSF^[[Mappings: Cybersecurity Framework and Privacy Framework to Rev. 5 (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/csf-pf-to-sp800-53r5-mappings.xlsx)]
	2. Replaced the term "information system" with "system," enabling the controls to be applied to other kinds systems (like IoT, general-purpose, etc.)^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#Fifth_revision)]

### What is Privacy?
1. DHS offers a compliance process to understand privacy requirements for your organization
	1. "The *privacy compliance* process is an *ongoing cycle* with *four key parts* to ensure appropriate oversight"^[[Compliance | Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/compliance)]
		1. Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA)
		2. Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA)
		3. System of Records Notice (SORN)
		4. Periodic Reviews
2. Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA)
3. Privacy Impact Analysis (PIA)
4. System of Records Notice (SORN)
5. Periodic Reviews


### Understanding the reference tool/controls
1. NIST provides a tool to easily navigate controls^[[Cybersecurity and Privacy Reference Tool | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cprt/catalog#/cprt/framework/version/SP_800_53_5_1_1/home)]
