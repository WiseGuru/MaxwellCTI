> If you are just getting started, I recommend [just reading it](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf) since it's only **32 pages** long. From the *Introduction* to *Appendix A* is **15 pages.** 

## What is it?
1. The CSF provides a *high-level overview of cybersecurity* concepts and outlines *six core functions:* Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
2. According the NIST, the *CSF* "provides guidance to industry, government agencies, and other organizations to manage cybersecurity risks."^[[nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.pdf)]
	1. "It offers a *taxonomy of high-level cybersecurity outcomes* that can be used by *any organization*... to better **understand**, **assess**, **prioritize**, and **communicate** its cybersecurity efforts."
	2. "The CSF does not prescribe how outcomes should be achieved."
		1. "Rather, it links to online resources that provide additional guidance on practices and controls that could be used to achieve those outcomes."
3. The CSF is composed of three components:
	1. *CSF Core*
		1. This is the broad outcomes mentioned earlier
		2. Intended to be understandable by executives and practitioners alike
	2. *CSF Organizational Profiles*
		1. Mechanisms for building an organization's profile that maps to the Core
		2. Can be used to understand *current* security posture or a desired *target* posture.
	3. *CSF Tiers*
		1. A method of characterizing the cybersecurity "rigor" of an organizational profile
4. Additional Resources
	1. Informative References
	2. Implementation Examples
	3. Quick-Start Guides
	4. Community Profiles and Organizational Profile Templates

## Six core functions
1. Govern
2. Identify
3. Protect
4. Detect
5. Respond
6. Recover
