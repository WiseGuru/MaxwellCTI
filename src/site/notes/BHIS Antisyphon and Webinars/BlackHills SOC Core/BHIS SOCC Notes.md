[SOC Core Skills w/ John Strand â€“ Antisyphon Training](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/on-demand-courses/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/)

First, this course was great; tons of great information, the brightest brains ripe for picking, an active live-chat with good conversation and exchange of information, and an infectiously energetic atmosphere. I registered for the live, *Pay What You Can* edition of this course, was able to attend all 4 days live and perform all the labs during the training. I'm sharing my notes (cleaned up and revisited so I don't accidentally share any of their copyrighted material) in hope that it helps someone out who's just getting started. 

If you can, I **highly** recommend you check out and attend their courses; this was a *Pay What You Can* course, and many of students took it for free. They also offer *On Demand* training if you're on a schedule, and *Live Courses* (that are note pay what you can), that cover a broader, more advanced range of topics.

# Day 1

## Section  1 - IP/TCP Headers
- General discussion of the IP header
	- Routers predominately are the devices that only look at the IP Header
- IP Header
	- [BGP Hijacking](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/)
		- APT/Nation-state actor can compromise an [ASN](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/) and redirect traffic to another destination
		- *Traffic is routed to the most specific address*
	- Fragmentation flags
		- x - bit 0
			- ["the evil bit"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_bit)
			- Reserved, but be 0
		- D (DF) - bit 1
			- Don't fragment
		- M (MF) - bit 2
			- More Fragments
- TCP Header
	- Describes the ports for the packets
		- Ports are *generally* used by certain protocols, but *generally*, ports can be used by any service
		- Port **0** can be used, and has been used as a 
	- [NAT/PAT](https://ccnadefinitions.com/ccna/20-definitions/nat/)
	- RFC 793 describes the 3-way handshake
		- Originally, it was a 4-way handshake, but most modern OS's send a 3-way instead.

#### tcpdump
- Unix/Linux CLI-based packet capture and analyzer utility that is extremely flexible
	- Also fun fact, the `man` page for `tcpdump` breaks down the [TCP header](https://ccnadefinitions.com/ccna/20-definitions/tcp/) 
- Not as feature-right as [[Tool Deep-Dives/Wireshark\|Wireshark]], but can run in more places with less overhead more quickly
- Important commands
	- `-D`
		- Lists interfaces
	- `-XA`
		- X is for Hex
		- A is for ASCII
	- `-w`
		- Write the data to a file
	- `-n`
		- Don't resolve hostname
	- `-r <file>`
		- Identify the file you're reading from
- Like Wireshark, you can also filter output by net, host, and/or port
	- `tcpdump host 192.168.1.2 port 80`
	- `tcpdump net 192.168.1.0/24 port 445`
- **CRITICALLY**, the output can be managed more easily when piped to various Linux commands
	- [[Tool Deep-Dives/less\|less]]
	- [[Tool Deep-Dives/grep\|grep]]

## The Lab

So first we go to the file, PACP open it, and sort by the host machine.
- `tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52`
	- `-n` 
		- Instructs tcpdump not to resolve the hostnames
		- This is key, because otherwise it stops every couple seconds to resolve domain names
	- `-r <file>` 
		- Identifies the file to modify
		- **NOTE**: It is helpful, nay necessary, to spell the filename correctly.
			- You can enter the first letter of the file and then press *tab* to autofill the file name

Many of the entries in the PCAP are broken up roughly like this:

`<time> <protocol> sourceip.protocol>targetip.port: flags seq# ack# <window size> <packet length> <packet contents protocol>`

Anyway, lots here to unpack, but a lot of chaff to sort through, so we'll filter further, tack on `and port 80` to filter only traffic through port 80 for HTTP traffic (or any traffic going over HTTP).

You can also string ports together using `or`, for example, `tcpdump -n -r magnitude_1hr.pcap host 192.168.99.52 and port 443 or 80`

We were already seeing a bunch of HTTP packets, so to help get a clearer picture of what's going on, we can add `-A` to show the packet contents, and see what data is being transmitted. This is also a ton of data, so we can pipe the output to `less` to make it easier to scroll.

In the first fill screen, we see that PowerShell is being sent from an external IP to our host private IP address, and it's encoded in [[Tool Deep-Dives/Base64\|Base64]]. Bad-bad! 

You can also filter by protocol; in the lab, they append `ip6` to the command to show only IPv6 entries, but you could filter by `arp`, `stp`, but not `lldp` for some reason.

# Linux
- It's the OS that's in basically everything, so get used to it.
- It comes in a variety of distributions or "distros"
	- **insert distinction between Linux and Unix here**
- Users and privileges
	- Becoming SU
		- `sudo su -`
			- This changes the terminal environment from running as user AS root, to actually BEING root

### File directories
| Root Directory | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| /bin | User binaries |  |
| /boot | Boot loader files |  |
| /dev | Device files |  |
| /etc | System configuration files |  |
| /home | User home directories |  |
| /lib | Libraries and kernel modules |  |
| /media | Removeable media mount point | Should have just been /mnt, but HERE WE ARE |
| /mnt | Mount point for temporary mounted file systems |  |
| /opt | Add-in application software packages |  |
| /sbin | System binaries |  |
| /srv | Data for services |  |
| /tmp | Temporary files |  |
| /usr | User utilities and applications |  |
| /var | Variable files |  |
| /root | Root user home directory |  |
| /proc | Virtual file system |  |

### Navigating Linux and directories
- `cd`
	- Change directory
	- Running without any changes will send you back to the home directory
- `ls`
	- Show any visible (non-hidden) files
	- `ls -lrta`
		- Shows hidden files
- `mkdir`
	- create directory
- `locate [string]`
	- It will search a file index to look for and list any locations
	- `sudo update db`
		- Update the index
- `ps aux`
	- List processes
