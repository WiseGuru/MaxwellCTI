# Introduction

[SOC Core Skills w/ John Strand â€“ Antisyphon Training](https://www.antisyphontraining.com/on-demand-courses/soc-core-skills-w-john-strand/)

First, this course was great; tons of great information, the brightest brains ripe for picking, an active live-chat with good conversation and exchange of information, and an infectiously energetic atmosphere. I registered for the live, *Pay What You Can* edition of this course, was able to attend all 4 days live and perform all the labs during the training. I'm sharing my notes (cleaned up and revisited so I don't accidentally share any of their copyrighted material) in hope that it helps someone out who's just getting started. 

If you can, I **highly** recommend you check out and attend their courses; this was a *Pay What You Can* course, and many of students took it for free. They also offer *On Demand* training if you're on a schedule, and *Live Courses* (that are note pay what you can), that cover a broader, more advanced range of topics.

Since the course was taught over 4 days from a 200-page slide deck, I'm going to organize my notes in order of instruction and general topic; as I explore and expand the notes, they may get broken off into their own tool deep-dives and linked back in previews (like [[Tool Deep-Dives/tcpdump\|tcpdump]]).

Side topics (like [[BHIS Antisyphon and Webinars/Career Growth/Discord Comments and Job Hunting\|Job Hunting]]) will get their own out-of-order page in the main folder.
