#### column
- The `column` command can align piped output into nicely formatted columns.
	- `-t`
		- Automatically determine the number of columns and create a table
		- Delimited by whitespace by default
		- Use `-s` to identify which characters delimit the columns for t


Note that, while not perfect, only one line is shifted left in the `column`'d output.
