#### xrdp
- *xrdp* is an open source [[Tool Deep-Dives/Windows/RDP\|RDP]] server for linux , allowing clients (e.g., [[Tool Deep-Dives/Linux/Remmina\|Remmina]]) to connect to Linux servers over the RDP protocol.
	- You might want to use xrdp over other protocols like [[VNC\|VNC]] because the RDP protocol is a little more efficient and (from a former Windows admin) a little easier to use.
- Like [[Tool Deep-Dives/Windows/RDP\|RDP]], *xrdp* connections can have an extra level of security by connecting over an [[Tool Deep-Dives/SSH/SSH\|SSH]]/[[Tool Deep-Dives/SSH/OpenSSH\|OpenSSH]] tunnel.
