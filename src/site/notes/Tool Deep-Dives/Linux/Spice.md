#### Spice
- "The SPICE project aims to provide a complete open source solution for remote access to virtual machines in a seamless way so you can play videos, record audio, share usb devices and share folders without complications."^[[Spice - Home](https://spice-space.org/)]
- Typically, I use [[Tool Deep-Dives/Linux/Spice\|Spice]] to connect to a locally installed #VM and easily pass through keyboard shortcuts and modify VM resolution/screen size.
