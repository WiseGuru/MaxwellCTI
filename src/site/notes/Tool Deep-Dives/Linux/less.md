#### less
- Linux command which makes a file's contents or a command's output more navigable.
	- *up and down arrows* to proceed or recede^[How weird is it that these words aren't spelled more similarly? According to etymonline, they share a root, so I wonder when that shift from "procede" to "proceed" occurred] line-by-line
	- *left and right arrows* to scroll right and left
	- *space bar/page down* to move forward one page
	- *page up/b* to move back one page
- Commands
	- `-S`
		- Don't wrap data
	- `-x<number>`
		- How wide each column should be
