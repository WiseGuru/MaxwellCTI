#### MITRE Engage
- "MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations that empowers you to engage your adversaries and achieve your cybersecurity goals."^[[MITRE Engage™ | An Adversary Engagement Framework from MITRE](https://engage.mitre.org/)]
	- Basically, it's a framework for active defensive measures; you *Expose*, *Affect (impact operations)*, and *Elicit information* from the adversaries
- Uses a *matrix* similar to [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/MITRE ATT&CK/MITRE ATT&CK\|MITRE ATT&CK]]
	- *Expose* - Reveal adversary activites
		- *Collect* - Passively gathering information from various sources
		- *Detect* - Laying traps and analyzing information from gathered information
	- *Affect* - Negatively impact adversary activities
		- *Prevent* - Stop adversary behavior
		- *Direct* - Encourage/discourage adversary behavior
			- Has some overlap with *Detect*
		- *Disrupt* - "Impair an adversary’s ability to conduct their operation as intended."^[[Matrix | MITRE Engage™](https://engage.mitre.org/matrix/?approach=disrupt)]
			- Frankly a little vague, but basically doing things to give the adversary a headache; impact network bandwidth, provide false information, etc.
	- *Elicit* - Trick the adversary into revealing additional information about their [[Definitions and Topics/TTPs\|TTPs]]
		- *Reassure* - Convince adversaries the decoys are real
		- *Motivate* - Create a safe "target-rich environment" for the adversary to act in that encourages them to reveal [[Definitions and Topics/TTPs\|TTPs]]
