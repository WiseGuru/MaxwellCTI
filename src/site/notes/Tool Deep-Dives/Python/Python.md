#### Python
- *Python* is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.^[[What is Python? Executive Summary | Python.org](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/)]
- It's super flexible and relatively easy to program and learn

My first steps learning it are documented here: [[Tool Deep-Dives/Python/Python Introduction\|Python Introduction]]

Additionally, scripts that I'm working on while learning Python are found here: [GitHub - WiseGuru/learning-python: The scripts and resources (e.g., CSV files, etc.) I'm using to learn Python.](https://github.com/WiseGuru/learning-python)
