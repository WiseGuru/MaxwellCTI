# Ventoy
[Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html)
Allows you to use a single, large USB drive to store and boot from multiple bootable ISOs. Super helpful if you're distro hopping or want multiple rescue CDs. Sometimes I've had mixed results if SecureBoot is enabled, so your mileage may vary.

# Hiren's BootCD
[Download | Hiren's BootCD PE](https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/)
Basically a stripped down Windows recovery OS with a ton of tools for repairing and recovering systems

# SystemRescue (formerly SystemRescueCD)
[SystemRescue - System Rescue Homepage](https://www.system-rescue.org/)
Linux system rescue toolkit available as a bootable medium for administrating or repairing your system and data after a crash.

# DBAN (Darik's Boot and Nuke)
[Data Removal: Darik's Boot and Nuke - DBAN](https://dban.org/)
Does what it says on the tin; systematically erase hard drives.
