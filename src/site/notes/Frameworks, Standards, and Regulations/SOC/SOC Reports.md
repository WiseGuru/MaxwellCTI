#### SOC Reports
- *SOC* (System and Organizational Controls) reports are independent attestation reports against a set of predefined criteria.
  - They are _reports_, not certifications, so organizations technically receive a “SOC 2 report” rather than achieve “SOC 2 compliance” (even though the shorthand is common).
- SOC reports are **not** security frameworks (like the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST CSF/NIST CSF\|NIST CSF]]); they simply map an organizations controls to the [AICPA](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/home)'s criteria and evaluate how effectively they are designed and operating.

## Different kinds of SOC reports
- Type 1 and Type 2 reports
	- Type 1 reports are evaluation from a point in time (e.g., April 20th)
	- Type 2 reports examine how an organization maintains controls over a time period.
- SOC 1 (Type 1/Type 2)
	- Financial audits; this is more generic and generally has to do with financial processing.
	- Organizations that handle financial data typically need a SOC 1 report.
- [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/SOC/SOC 2\|SOC 2]] (Type 1/Type 2)
	- Security report; expands on the SOC 1 control to include security
- SOC 3 (Type 2)
	- Redacted SOC 2 Type 2 report for public release
	- In practice, may be used for marketing, at conferences, etc.
- SOC 2+
	- Expands the subject matter of the SOC 2 report to include other common frameworks and criteria.
