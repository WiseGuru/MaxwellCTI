#### SOC 2
- 

#### SOC 2 Type 2
- "A SOC 2 Type 2 Report is a Service Organization Control (SOC) audit on how a cloud-based service provider handles sensitive information. It covers both the suitability of a company’s controls and its operating effectiveness."^[[SOC 2 Type 2 Compliance Guide: Everything You Need To Know | StrongDM](https://www.strongdm.com/blog/what-is-soc-2-type-2)]
- I'm not sure how it's actually perceived in the industry, but feels more like a marketing gimmick/exercise than a security exercise and ripe for abuse by limiting what's within scope.
	- Ostendio has a blog which discusses something similar:
		- "... the ability to manipulate the scope has led to significant abuse of this audit. This ability to manipulate the scope means that it is difficult to compare one SOC 2 with another and also allows organizations to avoid auditing areas that are perhaps their weakest link."^[[The Rise and Fall of SOC 2 audits](https://www.ostendio.com/blog/the-rise-and-fall-of-soc2-audits)]
	- It has to be conducted in good faith and paired with something like the NIST [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)\|RMF]] to actually be effective
