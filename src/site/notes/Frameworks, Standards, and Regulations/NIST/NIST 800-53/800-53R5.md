# What is it?
1. "**NIST Special Publication 800-53** is an [information security standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_security_standards "IT security standards") that provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for all U.S. federal [information systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_systems "Information systems") except those related to national security"^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53)]
	1. Revision 5 was published in Sept. 2020
	2. Revision 4 was officially withdrawn on Sept. 23, 2021^[[nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf)]
2. *Provides a critical framework*
	1. 20 control families
		1. Access Control, Risk Management, etc.
	2. Each family has a set of security controls that can be implemented
		1. In Rev. 4, controls were ordered by Priority, but Rev. 5 instead focuses on customized Risk Assessments to determine control priority.
3. *Flexible framework* that allows organizations to *tailor controls* to their organizations
	1. Achieved through risk assessments
4. *Required* for organizations with *federal information systems* that are **not** related to *national security*.
	1. These systems can be operated by the government or contractors working with the government.
5. **What are [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53A\|800-53A]] and [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53B\|800-53B]]?**
	1. They are supporting documents for the SP 800-53 that help users and organizations interpret and action the main document.
	2. *800-53A* is basically a guide on conducting *Security and Privacy Control Assessments* (e.g., audits).
		1. "800-53A provides a *set of procedures for conducting assessments* of *security... and privacy controls* employed within federal information systems and organizations."^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#800-53A)]
		2. The procedures are designed to be tailored to an organizations unique needs and risk tolerances.
	3. *800-53B* "provides a *set of baseline security... and privacy controls* for information systems and organizations."^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#800-53B)]
		1. Helps organizations choose an *appropriate baseline* of *security* and *privacy* controls for their system's **impact level**.
		2. Defines control impact levels relating to the three components of the [[Definitions and Topics/CIA Triad\|CIA Triad]] using the "high water mark" standard, where the highest-rated component defines the impact level of the entire system.
			1. *Low-impact* systems have *low* impact across the triad
			2. *Moderate-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *moderate*, and *nothing* that is rated *high*
			3. *High-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *high*

## Biggest functional/organizational differences between Rev. 4 and Rev. 5
1. The Executive Summary highlights these changes:
	1. Making controls *outcome based* (e.g. *what's the end result*) as opposed to *impact based* (e.g., *who is responsible for the work*) based
		1. This acknowledges that organizations can be complex with overlapping or separated responsibilities
	2. Integrating *security* and *privacy* controls (more on that later)
	3. Adding *Supply Chain Risk Management* to the list of control families
	4. Separating the *controls* and the *control selection process* (e.g., control priority) to encourage communities to use controls that pertinent to them
	5. Move *Control Baselines* into *NIST 800-53B* and the *Control Selection Process* into *NIST 800-37 (Risk Management Framework)*
	6. Adding clarity to the relationships between;
		1. Controls and requirements
		2. Security controls and Privacy controls
	7. Adding new and updated controls
2. [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/MITRE ATT&CK/MITRE ATT&CK\|MITRE]] created a spreadsheet tracking all updates from Rev.4 to Rev.5
	1. [Analysis of updates between 800-53 Rev. 5 and Rev. 4, by MITRE Corp. for ODNI (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r4-to-r5-comparison-workbook.xlsx)
3. Biggest thing is Privacy
	1. Privacy is now integrated across the entire document (instead of as a separate control), and the DHS Privacy Compliance process^[[Understanding privacy compliance](https://www.dhs.gov/compliance)] can be used to better understand its impact.
	2. NIST provides a document that maps the Rev.4 Privacy Controls to their appropriate sections in Rev.5^[[Mapping: Appendix J Privacy Controls (Rev. 4) to Rev. 5 (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/sp800-53r4-appj-to-r5-comparison.xlsx)]
4. Removal of the "Priority" metric
	1. Change to a "Risk Assessment" model tailored to the organization vs. universal "Priorities"
		1. Rev. 4's broad "*Priorities*" offered a fixed baseline across organizations, regardless of actual necessity
			1. Easier to deploy for many organizations, but could leave gaps
			2. For more outlier organizations, the priorities could be way off
		2. Rev. 5's "*Risk Assessment*" is more effortful up front, but provides a much clearer picture of necessity
			1. More overall system awareness and fewer blind spots
5. General language changes to be more inclusive and translate more easily between other frameworks
	1. More closely aligns with the NIST CSF^[[Mappings: Cybersecurity Framework and Privacy Framework to Rev. 5 (xlsx)](https://csrc.nist.gov/files/pubs/sp/800/53/r5/upd1/final/docs/csf-pf-to-sp800-53r5-mappings.xlsx)]
	2. Replaced the term "information system" with "system," enabling the controls to be applied to other kinds systems (like IoT, general-purpose, etc.)^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#Fifth_revision)]

## What is Privacy?
1. While "Privacy" is not concisely defined by The Privacy Act of 1974,^[This "Introduction to The Privacy Act" guide translates The Act into a human-readable format: https://dpcld.defense.gov/Portals/49/Documents/Privacy/2011%20DPCLO_Intro_Privacy_Act.pdf] we're given a definition of [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]] as a way to define the scope of the act.
	1. "*Information* about an individual *that identifies*, *links*, *relates*, or is *unique* to, or *describes* the *individual*"
		1. "e.g., a social security number; age; military rank; civilian grade; marital status; race; salary; home/office phone numbers; other demographic, biometric, personnel, medical, and financial information, etc."
	2. The introduction linked above also clearly states various ways to safeguard [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]].
3. DHS offers a compliance process for [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]]
	1. "The *privacy compliance* process is an *ongoing cycle* with *four key parts* to ensure appropriate oversight"^[[Compliance | Homeland Security](https://www.dhs.gov/compliance)]
		1. *Privacy Threshold Analysis* (PTA)
			1. Analysis determines if a system contains [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]] and requires additional analysis (i.e., performing a PIA)
			2. PTAs expire periodically
				1. Must be reviewed and re-certified every three years
		2. *Privacy Impact Analysis* (PIA)
			1. Once *any* [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]] is identified, the *PIA* analysis the breadth and scope by determining:
				1. What PII is being collected
				2. Why it's being collected
				3. How the PII will be handled (e.g. collected, stored, accessed, etc.)
		3. *System of Records Notice* (SORN)
			1. Federal agencies are required by The Privacy Act of 1974 to provide public notice of [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]] collection with a *SORN*.
				1. A *System of Records Notice* is "a formal document stating the information in the System of Records is collected and identifies what data the agency intends to collect, how the data will be used and safeguarded, who will have access, and other details."^[[Introduction to The Privacy Act](https://dpcld.defense.gov/Portals/49/Documents/Privacy/2011%20DPCLO_Intro_Privacy_Act.pdf)]
		4. *Periodic Reviews*
			1. PTAs and PIAs are reviewed every *three years* to ensure compliance
			2. SORNs are reviewed continually

# Notes from the official NIST 800-53 Course (as of 5/24/2024)
## NIST 800-53 Orientation
1. What are *Security and Privacy Controls*, and how are they different from *Requirements*?
	1. *Requirements* are the protection needs for a system or organization, and can vary depending on context
		1. Laws, compliance certifications, etc.
		2. Can be slow to change, and so tend to be broad and non-specific
	2. *Security and Privacy Controls* are specific measures to address *risks* and accomplish an organizations security and privacy objectives (e.g., *compliance requirements*)
		1. *Security controls* target *security* issues (e.g. the [[Definitions and Topics/CIA Triad\|CIA Triad]]), and overlap with *Privacy controls* on privacy and confidentiality (e.g., [[Definitions and Topics/PII\|PII]])
			1. What should be noted here is that NIST found privacy so important (or neglected) that they really have to spell it out.
		2. *Controls* are documented in their respective plans (the *security plan* and *privacy plan*)
	3. *Requirements* can set objectives for an organization, and *Controls* enable organizations to fulfill those objectives
2. Purpose of the *800-53*
	1. *800-53* provides a comprehensive catalog of security and privacy controls
	2. Supports the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)\|RMF]] "Select" and "Implement" steps
	3. Required in Federal InfoSec settings, but designed to support any organization across any sector
3. How to read controls
	1. *Control Identifier*
		1. Formatted XX-Y(Z)
			1. XX = Control family
			2. Y = Control number
				1. The order of controls does not imply importance or relevance to an organization
			3. (Z) = Control Enhancement
			4. e.g., *AC-2(3)* specifies the *Access Control* family, the *2nd* control (Account Management), and the *3rd* control enhancement (Disable Accounts)
		2. ID's and numbers are assigned alphabetically and in order of addition to the framework, and do not denote important
	2. *Base Control*
		1. Description of the control to be implemented
	3. *Organization-Defined Parameters* (*ODP*)
		1. Identifies *Assignments* and *Selections* to customize the control to the organization in *assignment operations*^[[assignment operation - Glossary | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/assignment_operation)]
			1. Additional details on tailoring and applying ODP values is found in [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53B\|800-53B]]
		2. *Assignments* are defined personnel/roles, time periods, conditions, etc.
			1. e.g., AC-2(5) has organizations define how long before an idle account is automatically logged out 
		3. *Selections* offer organizations a choice between different control mods according to their needs
			1. e.g., AC-2(7)(a)^[Note that the (a) here is not included in the official control identifier.] has organizations choose between a role- or attribute-based privileged account access scheme
	4. *Control Enhancement*
		1. Enhance a specific control
		2. Not intended to be selected independently
	5. *Discussion*
		1. Offers additional information and insight
		2. Often includes example
	6. *Related Controls*
		1. Controls that may further address a related security or privacy control statement/objective
	7. *References*
		1. Includes hyperlinks to applicable laws or background information to help organizations implement controls
		2. Not inclusive or complete
4. Control Families
	1. 20 control families
		1. [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/FIPS 200\|FIPS 200]] identified 17 security-related areas that led to the original control families
			1. Also identifies minimum security requirements
		2. 3 additional control families added since *FIPS 200* was published
			1. Program Management (*PM*), PII Processing and Transparency (*PT*), and Supply Chain Risk Management (*SR*)
	2. Control families arranged in alphabetical order of their identifiers when added to the framework
		1. Some identifiers, like *CA* for *Assessment, Authorization, and Monitoring*, don't make sense anymore withe new naming, but are maintained to keep families consistent
	3. *Appendix C* includes a catalog of controls
		1. Identify who implements the control (i.e. Organization and/or System, or if it has been Withdrawn)
			1. If Withdrawn, it mentions which control now incorporates it
				1. Withdrawn control numbers are not reused to maintain consistency within organizations across updates
		2. Also marks which controls provide *assurance* of security or privacy claims
			1. Critical for determining trust of systems
5. Controls Implementation approaches
	1. *Common* (e.g. shared, *inheritable*)
		1. Tied to a *common control provider* who is responsible for the implementation
		2. Controls are inheritable across different systems within the organization
			1. e.g. email, [[Definitions and Topics/EDR\|EDR]], etc.
		3. May centralize services across an organization, improving efficiency and reducing cost
		4. May introduce single points of failure that impact all connected systems
			1. e.g., if the org Exchange server crashes, it would impact the whole org
	3. *System-specific*
		1. Only the *system owner* and authorizing official are fully responsible
		2. However, could be used to exploit the organization as a whole
	4. *Hybrid*
		1. Shared between *common-control provider* and *system owner*
			1. Example given is an overarching [[Definitions and Topics/GRC\|GRC]] tool provided at the organization level, but system owners or expected to maintain the tool within their domains
		2. Risk is introduced if the *responsibility for implementation and management are unclear*
6. Updates and supporting documents
