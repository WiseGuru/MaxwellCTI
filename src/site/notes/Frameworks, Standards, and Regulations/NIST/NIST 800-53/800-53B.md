#### NIST SP 800-53B
1. *800-53B* "provides a *set of baseline security... and privacy controls* for information systems and organizations."^[[NIST Special Publication 800-53 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Special_Publication_800-53#800-53B)]
	1. Helps organizations choose an *appropriate baseline* of *security* and *privacy* controls for their system's **impact level**.
	2. Defines control impact levels relating to the three components of the [[Definitions and Topics/CIA Triad\|CIA Triad]] using the "high water mark" standard, where the highest-rated component defines the impact level of the entire system.
		1. *Low-impact* systems have *low* impact across the triad
		2. *Moderate-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *moderate*, and *nothing* that is rated *high*
		3. *High-impact* systems have *at least one* component that is rated as *high*
