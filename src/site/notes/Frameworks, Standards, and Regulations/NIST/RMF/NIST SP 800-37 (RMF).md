- "The Risk Management Framework (RMF) provides a process that integrates security, privacy, and cyber supply chainÂ risk management activities into the system development life cycle."^[[NIST Risk Management Framework | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/about-rmf)]

## Critical Documents in the RMF Process
These documents are required for FISMA compliance.^[[dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/23\_0803\_cpo\_ security-authorization-process-guide.pdf](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-08/23_0803_cpo_%20security-authorization-process-guide.pdf)]

- **Select Controls**
	- SSP: Security Plan
		- Defines what should be implemented
		- This is a living document; it should accurately describe the controls protecting the system
- **Assess Controls**
	- SAP: Assessment Plan
		- Defines how to test implementations
	- SAR: Assessment Report
		- Documents what was found
	- POA&M: Plan of Action and Milestone
		- Tracks what needs to be fixed

## RMF
1. The [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)\|RMF]] is a *7-step* continuous cycle to understand and provide a uniform approach to securing information systems
	1. These are the steps:
		1. Prepare
		2. Categorize
		3. Select
		4. Implement
		5. Assess (Audit)
		6. Authorize
		7. Monitor
2. RMF Step Guide
	1. **Prepare**:^[Not discussed in Gerald's video, but detailed here for reference.] Setup the organization for success
		1. Identify systems and stakeholders in the business and assign role for executing the RMF
		2. Conduct a risk assessment^[[SP 800-30 Rev. 1, Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments \| CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/30/r1/final)] and get a baseline of current risk and security practices
			1. 
	2. **Categorize**: Identifying potential impact
		1. [[FIPS 199\|FIPS 199]] and [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/FIPS 200\|FIPS 200]] are used to identify potential impact of a system
			1. Describes the importance of a system and steps required to secure it
		2. Impact ratings are chosen between High, Moderate, and Low
			1. Most systems have a *Moderate* impact systems
				1. *High* ratings are reserved for national security or classified systems
				2. *Low* ratings are also rare, non-business critical
			2. Over-speccing can lead to wasted resources, underspeccing can leave critical systems vulnerable
		3. [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST SP 800-60\|NIST SP 800-60]] provides guidelines on the impact you should assign to certain systems
			1. More on this here: [NIST RMF System Categorization Step Hands On (Using SP 800-60 Vol II) - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAfM2E2aJEM)
		4. The [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST CSF/NIST CSF\|NIST CSF]] 
	3. **Select**: Select controls to implement from [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53R5\|NIST 800-53]]
		1. The 800-53 is basically a big dictionary with hundreds of controls
			1. Start with the baseline for your system's impact in [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53B\|800-53B]]
			2. Tailor the controls to your organization
		2. The outcome of this step is the *SSP* ([[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/System Security Plan\|System Security Plan]]), and instructions on how to create one are found in the [NIST SP 800-18](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/18/r1/final)
			1. This is the book/plan for the documentation of your system
				1. Network diagram, who owns the system, what kind of data is stored, etc.
				2. All the controls to secure the systems and how they are implemented
					1. May be more or less complicated, depending on the size of the organization
			2. Gerald specifically mentions the [[NIST SP 800-15\|NIST SP 800-15]], but it was withdrawn in September of the year he published his video
	4. **Implement**: Implement the controls, the lions-share of the work
		1. If you have any challenges implementing controls, NIST has implementation guides for most systems
			1. Offer tons of instructions and things you can do
	5. **Assess**: Bring in an independent auditor to inspect your controls
		1. The *SSP* is used to create the *SAP* ([[System Assessment Plan\|System Assessment Plan]]) with the help of the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53A\|800-53A]]
			1. The plan should include information like:
				1. 				Duration of site visits
				2. Who need to be interviewed
				3. What evidence is required
				4. Which controls will be tested
				5. When the report will be delivered
			2. The auditor should have a solid understanding of the controls you are investigating and be able to provide color and ask questions beyond the stated control in the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53R5\|800-53R5]]
				1. The 800-53 can be quite technical, so making it understandable to regular humans is key.
		2.  The *SAR* ([[System Assessment Report\|System Assessment Report]]) and *POA&M* ([[Plan of Action and Milestrones\|Plan of Action and Milestrones]]) are created as part of this step
			1. The *SAR* includes all information for the controls assessed, including the auditor's findings
			2. The *POA&M* maps those findings to actionable items and is prepared by the system owner.
		3. For [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/FISMA\|FISMA]] or any kind of certification, organizations will need an external, independent auditor to conduct the assessment
	6. **Authorize**: Authorize the system
		1. Basically just a memo from the person responsible authorizing the system to operate
			1. Usually just a page or so with their signature
		2. What's missing in this (as of 2021) is a risk assessment
			1. Use [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-30\|NIST SP 800-30]] to asses risk
				1. Residual risk for controls not implemented, etc.
		3. This grants an Authorization to Operate for 1-3 years, depending on the requirements
	7. **Monitor**: Monitor the controls
		1. Systems are monitored and brought re-audited at regular intervals
		2. The system owners continue conducting assessments, risk treatment, and work on the implementing the POA&M
		3. Often the audits are often scheduled to be tested in a kind of sequence to prevent infrequent massive effort
