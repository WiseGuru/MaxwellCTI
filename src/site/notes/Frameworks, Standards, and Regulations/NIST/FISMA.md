#### FISMA
- The <u>Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014</u> (FISMA) amends the earlier Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 to "explicitly emphasizes a risk-based policy for cost-effective security."^[[NIST Risk Management Framework | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background)]
- FISMA applies to "*Federal agencies, contractors, or other sources* that provide *information security* for the *information and information systems*... \[in support of\] *the agency*."^[[NIST Risk Management Framework | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background)]
- In short, FISMA requires federal agencies to protect:
	- *Information* gathered or maintained *by or on behalf of* the agency
	- *Information systems* used or operated by *anyone remotely associated with a federal agency*
