#### FISMA
- The *Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014* (*FISMA*) amends the earlier Federal Information Security *Management* Act of 2002 to "**explicitly emphasizes a risk-based policy for cost-effective security.**"^[[NIST Risk Management Framework | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background)]
- Requires federal agencies to provide "*information security protections*" for:
	- *Information* gathered or maintained *by or on behalf of* an agency
	- *Information systems* used or operated by *anyone remotely associated with a federal agency*
- FISMA applies to "*Federal agencies, contractors, or other sources* that provide *information security* for the *information and information systems*... \[in support of\] *the agency*."^[[NIST Risk Management Framework | CSRC](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management/fisma-background)]
