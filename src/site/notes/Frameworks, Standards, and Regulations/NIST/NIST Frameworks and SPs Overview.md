**NIST** (the National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a US federal institution that does research and forms national standards. As it relates to cybersecurity frameworks, NIST has created several *frameworks* and *special publications* (SPs) that describe best-practices for certain processes and problems. Some SPs are broad (like the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)\|NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)]] or [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53R5\|800-53R5]]), where others are extremely narrow in their focus (like the [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST SP 800-60\|NIST SP 800-60]])

This is a brief orientation document to help you understand how some of the major docs relate to each other. 

- [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53R5\|NIST SP 800-53]]
	- A catalog of controls and linked supporting documents that can be used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of a system.
- [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/RMF/NIST SP 800-37 (RMF)\|NIST SP 800-37 - Risk Management Framework (RMF)]]
	- The RMF is a guiding prescriptive framework designed for use with federal regulations (like [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/FISMA\|FISMA]]).
	- It outlines requirements and supporting documents for systems seeking compliance with federal documents, drawing security controls from [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST 800-53/800-53R5\|NIST SP 800-53]].
	- Designed around selecting controls based on the risk and privacy categorization (Low/Medium/High) of the system.
- [[Frameworks, Standards, and Regulations/NIST/NIST CSF/NIST CSF\|NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)]]
	- The CSF is an elective framework designed for use by private organizations.
	- It is highly flexible and helps organizations to evaluate their security posture and plan improvements.
	- Is designed around accomplishing security objectives using whatever list of security controls your organization is using, like the ISO 27001, 800-53, etc.

> [!tip]
> The RMF and CSF are completely different frameworks that can draw from the same special publications.
